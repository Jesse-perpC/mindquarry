			<p> 
         The Mindquarry Collaboration Server is an Open Source infrastructure
				 for information workers of all kinds that allows them to share files,
				 share ideas and manage tasks.
         </p>
				 <p>Mindquarry has an easy to use web-interface and a zero-install
				 desktop client, but under the hood powerful open source software components
				 and applications are used.</p>
				 <subsection name="This Site">
				 	<p>
						This site provides an overview of resources valuable for developers
						of Mindquarry (this could be you) and developers that wish to use
						Mindquarry's components in their systems, which is possible thanks
						to Mindquarry's open source license (Mozilla Public License)
