  <section>
    <title>Development Prerequisites</title>

    <para>In order to develop Mindquarry, you need:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>A Java Development Kit, Version 1.5 or higher</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Apache Maven 2.0.4 or higher</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Subversion 1.3 or higher (a Subversion client is
        sufficient)</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Additional tools for Mindquarry development that are not neccessary,
    but ease the development process are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>An XML Editor</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>A good editor for Javascript and CSS</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>An IDE for Java Development</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>A good combination that has proven success in Mindquarry's
    development team is the Eclipse IDE with the Subclipse Plugin, oXygen XML
    Plugin and JSEclipse Javascript Editor Plugin.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Getting Mindquarry's Source Code</title>

    <para>Mindquarry consists of many small projects (Maven modules), each
    with its own Subversion repository.</para>

    <para>The easiest way to check out Mindquarry's source code is to check
    out the Mindquarry Meta-System, which includes all Mindquarry projects as
    externals. This includes everything neccessary to run the Mindquarry
    Webapplication.</para>

    <programlisting><prompt># </prompt>svn co https://www.mindquarry.org/repos/mindquarry-meta-system/trunk/ mindquarry</programlisting>

    <para>This command will put all of Mindquarry's source code into the
    directory <filename>mindquarry</filename>.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="build">
    <title>Building Mindquarry</title>

    <para>In order to build Mindquarry, run the following maven commands,
    starting in the <filename>mindquarry</filename> checkout directory.</para>

    <para><programlisting><prompt># cd mindquarry-base
# </prompt>mvn -N install
# mvn -f buildall-pom.xml install</programlisting>Maven will build all of
    Mindquarry's modules and download all dependencies neccessary for building
    Mindquarry.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Running Mindquarry in Development Mode</title>

    <para>In order to run Mindquarry, you have to to <phrase
    xlink:href="#build">build it first</phrase>. Afterwards you can switch to
    the directory
    <filename>mindquarry-webapp/mindquarry-webapplication</filename>.</para>

    <programlisting># cd ..  (going back to the mindquarry checkout directory)
# cd mindquarry-webapp/mindquarry-webapplication</programlisting>

    <para>As a first and initial step, you have to create a comfiguration file
    for running Mindquarry. The easiest way to do so is copying the file
    <filename>config.template/mindquarry-webapplication.properties</filename>
    to your current working directory. Modify the parameters according to your
    need, eg. the directories for the data storage and the server names
    (typically localhost during development). The most important setting one
    during development is <literal>org.apache.cocoon.mode</literal> which can
    be either <literal>dev</literal> (=development) or <literal>prod</literal>
    (=production). During development you want to use dev, because it turns
    off caching and will directly reload the resource files like css, js, xslt
    etc. (but not Java code) without restarting. Using prod makes the
    application much more faster but needs a rebuilt of the changed modules
    and a restart for the changes to effect.</para>

    <para>Then you can run <command>mvn jetty:run</command> to start the
    Mindquarry Web Application.</para>

    <programlisting># mvn jetty:run</programlisting>

    <para>After a short startup time, you can open Mindquarry in your web
    browser at the location <uri>http://localhost:8888/</uri>. Log in as user
    <literal>admin</literal> with password <literal>admin</literal> and create
    some test data.</para>

    <para>To shutdown the system, press <literal>CTRL+C</literal> in the
    console.</para>

    <para>For subsequent restarts during development, its good to clean the
    build because that will delete the cache of the webapplication. Package is
    then needed to rebuilt the mindquarry-webapplication module before it can
    be started with jetty:run.</para>

    <programlisting># mvn clean package jetty:run</programlisting>

    <para>If you change any Java code, you will need to rebuilt that module
    (<literal>mvn install</literal>) and then restart the webapplication. For
    all other resources (those located in Cocoon's <literal>COB-INF</literal>
    directory) this is not necessary when in dev mode.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Creating Patches</title>

    <para>In order to create patches, switch to the subdirectory of the
    affected module and type <command>svn diff</command>. After reviewing the
    output you can redirect the output into a patch file and send this file to
    <literal>bugs@mindquarry.com</literal>.</para>

    <programlisting># svn diff &gt; my-patch.patch</programlisting>
